The Meadow

A blade of grass blows in the breeze as its attempts to characterize itself have grown futile.
An ancient oak tree provides shade as it slowly drowns in its own shadow.
A thistle readily assumes a defensive stance as its potency begins to bleed dry.
A lone daisy basks in the sun as it realizes that its brilliance will one day wither away.

A raging fire burns everything that was once dreaded as it feeds itself again.
Shattered memories linger in the air as comforting winds of rest and peace purge the land.
Dark clouds form above the barren landscape as drops of pain and suffering pour down below.
The quiet flames of a dying saviour are ultimately quashed as pain gradually returns to the land.

A blade of grass blows in the breeze as its attempts to characterize itself grow futile once more.
An oak tree provides shade as it slowly drowns in its own shadow once more.
A thistle readily assumes a defensive stance as its potency begins to bleed dry once more.
A lone daisy basks in the sun as it realizes once more that its brilliance will one day wither away.

Disease plagues the land as peace is restored.
Shattered memories linger in the air as the landscape becomes devoid of all misery.
A seed pod approaches the barren landscape just as a feeling of eternal rest smothers the land.
As their saviour is expelled, a single blade of grass blows in the breeze.

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
